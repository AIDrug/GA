# Directory Navigator: 
The code for this repository is arranged based on the experiments of the paper. Particularly: 
- [Experiment 4.1: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.1) Unconstrained optimization and comparison with other generative models
- [Experiment 4.2: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.2) Long term experiment with a time-dependent adaptive penalty
- [Experiment 4.3: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.3) Analysis of molecule classes explored by the GA
- [Experiment 4.4: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.4) Constrained optimization
- [Experiment 4.5: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.5) Simultaneous logP and QED optimization
- [Experiment 4.6: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.6) Modification of the hyperparameter beta
- [CLEAN: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/CLEAN) A cleaner version of the code (recommend for running your experiments)

Instructions on running the code are provided in the above links. Please note that the code has been parallelized based on the number of CPU cores for quick property evaluations.



# Prerequisites

Before running the code, please ensure you have the following:


- [SELFIES (any version)](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies) - 
  The code was run with v0.1.1 (which is the fastest), however, the code is compatible with any version. 
- [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)
- [tensorboardX](https://pypi.org/project/tensorboardX/)
- [Pytorch v0.4.1](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Python 3.0 or up](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
