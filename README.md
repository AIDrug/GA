# Directory Navigator: 
The code for this repository is arranged based on the experiments of the paper. Particularly: 
- [Experiment 1: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.1) Unconstrained optimization and comparison with other generative models
- [Experiment 2: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.2) Long term experiment with a time-dependent adaptive penalty
- [Experiment 3: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.3) Analysis of molecule classes explored by the GA
- [Experiment 4: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.4) Constrained optimization
- [Experiment 5: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.5) Simultaneous logP and QED optimization
- [Experiment 6: ](https://github.com/akshat998/GA/tree/master/4.6) Modification of the hyperparameter beta
Instructions on running the code are provided in the above links.


# Prerequisite

Before running the code, please ensure you have the following:


- [SELFIES (any version)](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies) - 
  The code was run with v0.1.1 (which is the fastest), however, the code is compatible with any version. 
- [Python 3.0 or up](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [Pytorch v0.4.1](https://pytorch.org/)
- [tensorboardX](https://pypi.org/project/tensorboardX/)
